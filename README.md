# Umamusume Legacy Loops

So, you want to train a tight legacy loop of 4 umas? Well, you've come to the right place! This guide will help you decide whether your chosen umas can form a viable legacy loop.

To get a detailed understanding of how legacies work, please read [this Gametora article](https://gametora.com/umamusume/legacies).

## How to use this guide

First you pick a quartet of umas you have, preferably as high on the list a possible.

Next, you're going to get started doing careers with your selections. If none of your chosen umas have veterans, then simply starting doing them randomly.

When you have veterans for each uma, you can start going through legacy set-ups as shown below:

|           | Girl 1  | Girl 2  | Girl 3  | Girl 4  |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Session 1 | Trainee | Legacy  | Legacy  |         |
| Session 2 | Legacy  | Legacy  |         | Trainee |
| Session 3 | Legacy  |         | Trainee | Legacy  |
| Session 4 |         | Trainee | Legacy  | Legacy  |

By sticking to this pattern, you can keep up the double-o affinity levels.

## Things missing from this list

Values are borrowed from [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/UmaMusume/comments/m3vsbz/inheritance_compatibility_chart_wip_by_kohinata/) fellow redditors post. Anything later than Curren Chan is not in their list, so it is not here either.

The linked Gametora article provides a link to a compatibility calculator. As you might notice from using that, there is a *Legacies' affinity* addition to the score. I do not know exactly how this is calculated, thus the values have been excluded from my calculations. I have, however, found that the values are still a solid guide, which I why I have decided to share it.
